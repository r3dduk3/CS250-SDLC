Essential Questions for Computer Scientists

1.	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The best way to interpret user needs is to find out, not only what they want, but why they want it. By basically asking three questions:
•	As a(n) <type of user>
•	I want to <perform some task>
•	So that I can <achieve some goal>
You build a ‘story’ that puts the answers into a easily understood scenario that a development team can use to create a useable program.
2.  How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Right now I don’t develop programs, I’m a tester. However, in an agile environment, I could see my position as creating test cases that the actual coders could use to clarify what their code needs to accomplish. I can also learn more about coding so I can be truly cross-functional. I don’t see myself as becoming a coder, but I can sometimes find errors in code that has been written. 
3.	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is a good team member, no matter the environment – whether in corporate America or on the battlefield. A good team member has integrity. They are honest about what they can do and what they expect from others. They are trustworthy; they get the job done or you’ll know why they didn’t/couldn’t.
